## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Page Load**
```javascript
checkRegistration() → 
  If localStorage has 'emasVoter':
    → Load voter info
    → Load voting history from Firebase
    → Render positions
  Else:
    → Show registration modal
```

### 2. **Registration Flow**
```javascript
User fills form → 
  Validate input →
  Check if roll exists in Firebase →
    If exists: Show error
    Else:
      → Save to Firebase (/voters/{roll})
      → Save to localStorage
      → Show positions
```

### 3. **Voting Flow**
```javascript
Click position card →
  Open candidates modal →
  Click "Vote" button →
  Confirm dialog →
    If confirmed:
      → Save vote to Firebase (/votes/{position}/{roll})
      → Update local state
      → Show success message
      → Re-render positions with "Voted" badge
```

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Adding New Positions
Edit the `electionData` object in `election.html`:

```javascript
const electionData = {
  newPosition: {
    title: "New Position Title",
    icon: "lucide-icon-name",  // See https://lucide.dev
    description: "Position description",
    candidates: [
      { id: "np1", name: "Candidate Name", image: "image-url" }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Changing Candidate Photos
Replace placeholder URLs in `candidates` array:
```javascript
image: "https://your-image-url.com/photo.jpg"
```

### Modifying Colors
Update Tailwind classes in the HTML or add custom CSS:
```css
/* Change primary color */
.bg-red-600 → .bg-blue-600
.text-red-500 → .text-blue-500
```
